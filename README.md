# WinterGame
This is a video game created using C and OpenGL where the user explores a snowy world filled with penguins in first person.  Below is a screenshot of what the game looks like when running.  I built this game from scratch creating all the objects, lighting, and features using C and OpenGL.

If you decide to build this game on your own local computer using the makefile I created, then you can exercise my program with the following commands:

s/S               Create a foggy storm scene!

arrow keys        Change the angle at which you are viewing the scene

PgDn/PgUp         Zoom in and out of the scene

c                 Change the axis that the sun orbits

u                 Change the elevation of the sun

U                 Change the elevation of the sun other way

ESC               Exit the program
